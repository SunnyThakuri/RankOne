              <h2 className="pt-[24px] md:pt-[48px] text-[16px] md:text-[18px]">Discover how CSS Grid and Flexbox differ in layout design. Learn how Grid handles complex, multi-dimensional layouts, while Flexbox simplifies one-dimensional alignment and distribution.</h2>

              <p className="pt-[10px] md:pt-[20px]">CSS Grid and Flexbox are two essential layout systems in modern web development. Grid offers a powerful, two-dimensional approach, enabling complex designs with precise control over rows and columns. Flexbox, on the other hand, excels in one-dimensional layouts, making it ideal for aligning and distributing items along a single axis. Understanding their unique strengths helps developers choose the best tool for their design needs.</p>
              <p className="pt-[10px] md:pt-[20px]">CSS Grid and Flexbox provide distinct approaches to web layout design. Grid is perfect for creating intricate, two-dimensional layouts with both rows and columns, offering precise control over positioning. Flexbox is ideal for simpler, one-dimensional layouts, focusing on alignment and distribution along a single axis. Mastering both systems allows developers to tackle various design challenges efficiently and effectively</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pt-[10px] md:pt-[20px] pl-[20px] md:pl-[30px]">
                <li>Layout Dimensions: Grid handles both rows and columns simultaneously (two-dimensional), while Flexbox manages items along a single axis (one-dimensional).</li>
                <li>Complexity: Grid is suited for complex layouts with multiple elements needing precise control, whereas Flexbox is ideal for simpler, linear arrangements.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Grid provides more granular control over item placement and alignment in both dimensions, while Flexbox offers alignment mainly along the main and cross axes</li>
                <li>Item Placement: Grid allows explicit placement of items in specific grid cells, while Flexbox arranges items sequentially in the container’s direction.</li>
                <li>Responsive Design: Both can be used for responsive designs, but Grid excels in creating complex, responsive layouts with both rows and columns.</li>
                <li>Order Control: Flexbox allows changing the order of items easily without altering HTML structure, whereas Grid requires defining specific grid areas for reordering.</li>
                <li>Performance: Grid can be more performance-efficient for complex layouts since it reduces the need for nested elements compared to Flexbox.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="pt-[10px] md:pt-[20px]">CSS Grid and Flexbox are both essential tools for web layout design, each with unique strengths. Grid excels in creating complex, two-dimensional layouts with precise control over both rows and columns, making it ideal for intricate designs. Flexbox, on the other hand, is perfect for one-dimensional layouts, focusing on alignment and distribution along a single axis.

              <ul className="list-disc">
                <li>Implicit vs. Explicit: Grid supports explicit grid definitions and implicit content placement, while Flexbox works with implicit layouts based on the container’s content</li>
                <li>Overlapping Elements: Grid allows overlapping items, which is useful for advanced designs, whereas Flexbox arranges items without overlapping.</li>
                <li>Content vs. Container Sizing: Flexbox often relies on content size to determine layout, while Grid allows for fixed-size or fractional units independent of content.</li>
                <li>Container Flexibility: Flexbox is more flexible for dynamic content as it adjusts item sizes and positions based on the container’s size, while Grid is more rigid but powerful for static layouts.</li>
                <li>Alignment on the Cross Axis: Flexbox provides straightforward cross-axis alignment (e.g., centering items), while Grid offers more control for both horizontal and vertical alignment.</li>
