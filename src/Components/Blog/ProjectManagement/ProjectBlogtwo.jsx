              <h2 className="pt-[24px] md:pt-[48px] text-[16px] md:text-[18px]">Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential issues that could impact project success. Effective strategies ensure proactive handling of risks and minimize their impact.</h2>

              <p className="pt-[10px] md:pt-[20px]">Risk management is essential for project success, involving systematic processes to identify, assess, and prioritize potential risks. By developing strategies to mitigate or manage these risks, project managers can prevent issues from escalating and impacting project outcomes. Effective risk management includes creating contingency plans, monitoring risks throughout the project lifecycle, and adapting strategies as necessary to ensure project objectives are met and resources are optimized.</p>

              <p className="pt-[10px] md:pt-[20px]">Managing risks effectively is crucial for project success. This involves identifying potential risks early, assessing their impact and likelihood, and developing mitigation strategies. Regular monitoring and updating of risk management plans help address new risks as they arise. Proactively managing risks minimizes their impact on project objectives and ensures smoother execution, better resource allocation, and increased chances of achieving project goals.</p>
